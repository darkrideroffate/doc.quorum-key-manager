# Release types

Quorum Key Manager has 2 different release types - long term support (LTS) releases and interim releases.

LTS releases are reliable, production-ready releases that are updated and supported throughout the lifetime of the release. LTS releases are supported for 12 months and are patched with every bug fix during the course of its support timeline. LTS releases are marked `LTS` in the [release notes](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-key-manager/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

Interim releases provide access to recent features that may still be experimental and are not recommended for production. Use interim releases for testing and development purposes. Interim releases are published between LTS releases.
